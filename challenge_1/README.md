# Challenge 1: Book or Magazine Design

## Objectives
The objective for this challenge is to level up front-end skills by creating something with pure CSS. By having different people work on the same challenge, we can share different approaches and learn together.

Some potential focus areas:

### - Accessibility
Sometimes we forget about challenges that we all face. As developers, it’s up to us to make the world of software welcoming and safe for everyone. This is a big topic with lots of range, including considerations like sight, sound, and cognitive impairment and assistive technologies.

### - Latest CSS (2022)
The underlying technologies of the web are always changing. Try using the latest available CSS to learn what’s now available.

### - HTML5 + Semantics
Semantics are the structure of your code. Better HTML semantics result in easier, faster understanding by search engines, assistive technologies (especially screen readers), and future developers. Bonus: helpful semantics can help cut down on users’ overall number of searches on a topic.

## Challenge
Chose a book or magazine cover/set of pages and try to recreate it using only the files provided:
- index.html
- main.css

** While doing the challenge, ask yourself the following questions:
If I had X disability, how would that affect my perception on Y?
What’s the most essential level of functionality here? Is there a way to make the bells and whistles progressive enhancements? 

Write a short summary or be prepared to discuss:
- What did I learn by doing this challenge?
- Is there something I did differently from what I am used to?
- What was the hardest/simplest thing you did?
- Did you enjoy the challenge?

There is no time restriction, you can put in as much time as you want.

Restrictions:
- No: framework or other CSS, everything has to be done from scratch
- No: text on images
- Yes: importing fonts
